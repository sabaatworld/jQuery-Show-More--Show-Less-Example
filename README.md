jQuery-Show-More--Show-Less-Example
===================================

A complete and easy implementation of the 'Show More' / 'Show Less' plugin

This example code illustrates a simple way to setup your own 'Show More' / 'Show Less' feature using jQuery on pages in which you may want to display a large amount of text.

There are already a lot of plugins which do the job, but they do not provide all the features that I want. The code in this repo will basically help you understand how to make this work. It's not exactly a plugin.
